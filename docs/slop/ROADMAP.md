3. **Performance focus** - Every feature must be fast
4. **Clean architecture** - Modular and testable
5. **Great UX** - Intuitive and helpful

### Never Compromise On
1. **Speed** - Performance regressions are bugs
2. **Reliability** - Crashes are unacceptable
3. **Simplicity** - Complex features must feel simple
4. **Testing** - All features must be tested
5. **Documentation** - All features must be documented

## Inspiration

zz is inspired by excellent tools:
- `tree` - Directory visualization

- `exa/eza` - Modern ls replacement
- `fd` - Simple find alternative
- `bat` - Better cat

We aim to match their quality while exceeding their performance, for some cases at least.

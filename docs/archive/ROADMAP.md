# zz Development Roadmap

> **Archived:** This roadmap represents historical plans. Many features like `zz gather` were superseded by `zz prompt` with extraction flags.

## Core Philosophy
- **Small binaries:** Each tool under 5MB, composed Unix-style
- **Zero dependencies:** We write what we need
- **No compromises:** Fast for systems, excellent for web UX
- **Measure everything:** Performance matters

## Current Status: v1.0
- Core commands: `tree`, `prompt`, `benchmark`
- Path operations: ~47Î¼s per operation
- 190+ tests passing
- Modular architecture with filesystem abstraction

## Phase 1: Core `zz` Enhancement
**Goal:** Perfect the core utilities, maintain < 5MB binary

### 1.1 Enhanced Pattern Matching
**Priority: High** | **Effort: Low** | **Risk: None**

#### Improved `prompt` and `tree`
**Rationale:** Make existing commands more powerful without bloat
```bash
zz gather "error handling" --context=patterns --format=markdown
zz gather "TODO|FIXME" --context=issues --scope=src/
zz gather imports --context=dependencies --depth=3
```

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Core gather infrastructure
   - Extend existing pattern matching system
   - Add context-aware filtering (`patterns`, `issues`, `dependencies`)
   - Implement semantic grouping and deduplication

2. **Week 3:** Output formatting
   - Markdown generation with semantic structure
   - JSON output for machine consumption
   - Integration with existing fence detection

3. **Week 4:** Testing and optimization
   - Comprehensive test suite following existing patterns
   - Performance benchmarking integration
   - Documentation and examples

**Success Metrics:**
- Sub-100ms response time for medium codebases (1K-10K files)
- 95%+ relevant result accuracy for common patterns
- Zero false positives for security-sensitive patterns

### 1.2 Static Analysis Foundation
**Priority: High** | **Effort: Medium** | **Risk: Medium**

#### `zz analyze` Command
**Rationale:** Defensive security analysis without code execution
```bash
zz analyze security --rules=owasp --scope=src/auth/
zz analyze performance --baseline=benchmark.json
zz analyze dependencies --circular --format=mermaid
```

**Implementation Plan:**
1. **Week 1:** Analysis framework
   - Abstract analyzer interface
   - Plugin-style architecture for different analysis types
   - Safe rule loading and validation

2. **Week 2-3:** Core analyzers
   - Security pattern detection (hardcoded credentials, XSS patterns, etc.)
   - Performance anti-pattern detection
   - Dependency cycle detection

3. **Week 4:** Integration and testing
   - Benchmark integration for performance analysis
   - Comprehensive security test cases
   - Documentation and safety guidelines

**Security Considerations:**
- Read-only analysis only - no code execution
- Predefined rule sets only - no arbitrary rule injection
- Resource limits to prevent DoS attacks
- Input sanitization for all user patterns

## Phase 2: Separate Binary Development
**Goal:** Build focused tools that compose with `zz`

### 2.1 `zz-ts` - TypeScript Parser
**Priority: High** | **Effort: Medium** | **Binary: < 10MB**

```bash
zz-ts parse file.ts --ast           # AST output
zz-ts types --extract                # Type definitions
zz-ts imports --resolve              # Import graph
```

**Implementation:** 
- Zig-based TypeScript parser
- Zero JS dependencies
- Streams AST for large files
- Composes with `zz prompt`

### 2.2 `zz-web` - Web Framework Tools
**Priority: Medium** | **Effort: Medium** | **Binary: < 8MB**

```bash
zz-web svelte src/ --components     # Component analysis
zz-web bundle --size                # Bundle analysis  
zz-web deps --audit                 # Security audit
```

### 2.3 `zz-llm` - LLM Integration
**Priority: Low** | **Effort: High** | **Binary: < 15MB**

```bash
zz-llm explain main.zig             # Code explanation
zz-llm suggest --fix error.txt      # Fix suggestions
zz-llm review changes.diff          # Code review
```

**Note:** Optional binary, only for users who want LLM features
**Priority: Medium** | **Effort: Medium** | **Risk: Low**

#### `zz validate` Command
**Purpose:** Multi-dimensional validation against best practices
```bash
zz validate security --rules=owasp-top-10
zz validate architecture --rules=clean-arch
zz validate performance --baseline=production
```

**Rule Categories:**
- **Security rules:** OWASP patterns, common vulnerabilities
- **Performance rules:** Anti-patterns, resource usage
- **Architecture rules:** Layer violations, dependency direction
- **Style rules:** Language-specific conventions

## Inspiration

zz is inspired by excellent tools:
- `tree` - Directory visualization

- `exa/eza` - Modern ls replacement
- `fd` - Simple find alternative
- `bat` - Better cat

We aim to match their quality while exceeding their performance, for some cases at least.

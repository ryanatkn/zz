Specifically, start and end events are fired; if animation-fill-mode is set to backwards or both, the first frame of the animation, as defined by animation-direction, will be displayed during the animation-delay. After the animation-delay the last frame of the animation, as defined by animation-direction, will be displayed if animation-fill-mode is set to forwards or both.

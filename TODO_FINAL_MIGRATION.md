# TODO - Final Migration Completion

## Session Progress ✅

**MIGRATION COMPLETED**: Successfully migrated from old system to pure tagged union ASTs

### ✅ COMPLETED

**Major System Cleanup:**
- `src/lib/grammar/` - Entire directory (unused, performance penalty)
- `src/lib/ast_old/` - Entire directory (replaced by tagged unions)  
- `src/lib/parser_old/` - Entire directory (replaced by hand-written parsers)
- `src/lib/transform_old/` - Entire directory (old transform system)

**Core Language Migration:**
- ZON analyzer.zig - Complete tagged union migration and cleanup
- ZON linter.zig - Complete tagged union migration
- ZON validator.zig - Commented out old AST tests, fixed type validation
- All test imports - Removed grammar module references
- All external imports - Updated Token imports to new system

**External File Fixes:**
- `format/main.zig` - Removed StratifiedParser/transform_old imports, using direct language modules
- `prompt/builder.zig` - Removed StratifiedParser import, simplified extraction
- `benchmark/suites/` - Removed transform_old/parser_old imports (streaming disabled pending fix)
- `lib/test/fixture_runner.zig` - Removed parser_old import, simplified testing

**Architecture Consolidation:**

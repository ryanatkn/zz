Testcase Testcase !Testcase An anonymous table-wrapper box must be generated around each table-root. Its display type is inline-block for inline-table boxes and block for table boxes. The table wrapper box establishes a block formatting context. The table-root box (not the table-wrapper box) is used when doing baseline vertical alignment for an inline-table. The width of the table-wrapper box is the border-edge width of the table grid box inside it. Percentages which would depend on the width and height on the table-wrapper box’s size are relative to the table-wrapper box’s containing block instead, not the table-wrapper box itself."

# Phase 6 - Stream-First Integration (JSON/ZON Focus)

## Status: IN PROGRESS

Integrating DirectStream architecture into CLI commands and completing JSON/ZON native stream lexers.

## Completed Work

### stream-demo Command ✅
Created new CLI command to showcase DirectStream architecture:
- **Location**: `src/stream_demo/`
- **Features**:
  - Performance comparison: DirectStream vs vtable Stream
  - Query demo: DirectFactStream with SQL-like queries
  - Tokenization demo: JSON/ZON with DirectTokenStream
- **Status**: Working but query demo has Value union corruption issue

### Command Structure
```zig
// DirectStream usage example
var stream = directFromSlice(i32, data);
while (try stream.next()) |item| {
    // 1-2 cycle dispatch
}

// DirectFactStream query
var builder = QueryBuilder.init(allocator);
_ = builder.selectAll().from(&store);
_ = try builder.where(.confidence, .gte, 0.8);
var stream = try builder.directExecuteStream();
```

## Test Results
- **Tokenization**: ✅ Working - JSON/ZON tokenize successfully
- **Performance**: ⚠️ Simple iteration shows vtable faster (needs investigation)
- **Query**: ✅ FIXED - DirectFactStream queries working correctly

## Known Issues

### 1. ~~Query Executor Value Corruption~~ ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Switch on corrupt value when comparing confidence
**Solution**: Fixed by correcting Value type conversion for fact.confidence field

### 2. ~~Memory Leaks in DirectStream~~ ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Query and context allocated but never freed
**Solution**: Clean Zig pattern:
- Query allocated on stack (no heap allocation)
- Context copies only needed fields (small structs)
- GeneratorStream has cleanup callback
- Users must call `defer stream.close()` for proper cleanup

### 2. Performance Anomaly
**Problem**: DirectStream showing slower than vtable in simple iteration
**Measured**: DirectStream ~43 cycles vs vtable ~39 cycles (0.9x speed)
**Possible causes**:
- Arena allocation overhead for operators
- CPU branch prediction favoring vtable in simple cases
- Simple iteration doesn't benefit from DirectStream's advantages
- Need more complex scenarios with multiple operators

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: ~~Fix Query Executor~~ ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Added proper Value type conversion for confidence field
- ✅ Fixed query lifetime management for DirectStream
- ✅ Verified with multiple predicate/confidence combinations

### Priority 2: Complete Stream Lexers
- Implement `JsonStreamLexer.toDirectStream()`
- Implement `ZonStreamLexer.toDirectStream()`
- Remove dependency on iterator pattern

### Priority 3: Stream-First Modules
1. **format_stream**: New formatting using DirectTokenStream
2. **extract_stream**: Code extraction using DirectFactStream
3. Integration with existing commands via --stream flag

## Architecture Achievements
- ✅ Created working demo of DirectStream architecture
- ✅ Integrated with CLI command system
- ✅ JSON/ZON tokenization working with stream lexers
- ✅ Query engine supports DirectFactStream
- ✅ Clean module organization:
  - Formatters live with their languages (languages/json/stream_format.zig)
  - Generic formatting utilities in stream module (stream/format.zig)
  - Removed legacy LexerBridge and StreamAdapter
- ⚠️ Performance validation pending

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/stream_demo/main.zig` - Command entry point
- `src/stream_demo/examples.zig` - Sample data and scenarios
- `src/stream_demo/benchmarks.zig` - Performance comparisons

### Modified Files
- `src/cli/command.zig` - Added stream_demo command
- `src/cli/runner.zig` - Added stream_demo dispatch
- `src/cli/help.zig` - Added stream_demo help text

## Performance Metrics

### Tokenization
- JSON: 27 tokens processed efficiently
- ZON: 14 tokens with proper dispatch

### Stream Dispatch (Measured)
- DirectStream: ~66 cycles (higher than expected)
- Vtable Stream: ~38 cycles
- **Investigation needed**: Arena allocation overhead suspected

## Recent Progress (Session Update)

### stream/extract.zig Module ✅
Created fact extraction module following stream/format.zig pattern:
- **Location**: `src/lib/stream/extract.zig` and `extract_options.zig`
- **Features**: 
  - Extract facts from DirectTokenStream
  - BasicExtractor for JSON/ZON demonstration
  - Configurable extraction options
  - Zero-allocation pipeline design
- **Status**: Module created and integrated into test suite

### stream-demo Formatting ✅  
Enhanced stream-demo command with formatting demonstration:
- Added `--formatting` flag to showcase pipeline
- Demonstrates DirectTokenStream → Formatter flow
- Shows token processing with 1-2 cycle dispatch
- Note: Full value-preserving formatting requires source access (TODO)

### Test Integration ✅
- Added stream/format.zig to test_stream_first.zig
- Added stream/extract.zig to test_stream_first.zig
- Both modules now part of stream-first test suite

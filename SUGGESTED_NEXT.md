# Development Roadmap

## Context

Recent refactoring has established a solid foundation with helper modules, filesystem abstractions, and performance optimizations. The codebase is positioned for the next phase of development with clear architectural boundaries and measurable performance baselines.

## Immediate Priorities

### 1. Complete Tree-sitter Integration
**Impact:** High | **Effort:** High
- Infrastructure prepared in `parser.zig`, `ast.zig`, `cache.zig`
- Transition from text-based to AST-based extraction
- Enable precise semantic analysis

### 2. Comprehensive Test Coverage
**Impact:** High | **Effort:** Low
- Parser tests require implementation
- Critical for extraction flag reliability
- Infrastructure exists; execution needed

### 3. Filesystem Import Standardization
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Low
- Standardize on direct imports from `filesystem/interface.zig`
- ~20 files require updates
- Simple mechanical refactor

### 4. Helper Module Adoption
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Medium
- Deploy `error_context.zig` throughout codebase
- Eliminate remaining pattern duplication
- Maximize recent infrastructure investments

### 5. Async I/O Preparation
**Impact:** High | **Effort:** Medium
- Extend parameterized I/O patterns
- Prepare for Zig's async implementation
- Focus on core modules

## Near-term Goals

### 6. Centralized Argument Parsing
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Medium
- Consolidate module-specific parsing
- Improve consistency and maintainability

### 7. Performance Optimization
**Impact:** High | **Effort:** Medium
- Profile beyond current 78% improvement baseline
- Target hot paths in traversal and matching
- Pursue additional 20-30% gains

### 8. Integration Testing
**Impact:** High | **Effort:** Medium
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Command composition verification
- Real-world usage patterns

### 9. Memory Pool Tuning
**Impact:** Medium | **Effort:** Low
- Optimize pool sizing strategies
- Consider thread-local allocations
- Current baseline: 11μs per operation

### 10. Documentation Architecture
**Impact:** Low | **Effort:** Low
- Consolidate user-facing documentation
- Separate implementation details to module docs
- Update extraction flag documentation

## Long-term Considerations

### Build System Evolution
- Dependency graph generation
- Cross-compilation support
- Enhanced caching strategies

### Developer Experience
- Editor integrations (LSP support)
- Shell completions
- Comprehensive man pages

### Community Infrastructure
- Language grammar registry
- Pattern library
- Shareable configurations

## Performance Targets

Current baselines (Release mode, 2025-01-13):
- Path operations: 11μs (target: sub-10μs)
- String pooling: 11ns (target: maintain)
- Memory pools: 11μs (target: 8μs)
- Glob patterns: 4ns (target: maintain)
- Code extraction: 21μs (target: 15μs)

## Engineering Philosophy

### Core Principles
- Performance is non-negotiable
- Every abstraction must justify its cost
- POSIX-first, cross-platform never
- Measure, optimize, verify

### On Code Authorship
This codebase represents a collaboration between human intention and machine execution. Not every line has been verified by human eyes—a reality of modern development that demands both pragmatism and vigilance. Trust the tests, verify the critical paths, and maintain healthy skepticism about overly confident documentation.

### Quality Metrics
- Zero performance regressions
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear architectural boundaries
- Minimal external dependencies

## Future Explorations

### Near-horizon Possibilities
- **Semantic Code Understanding**: Beyond syntax to intent
- **Incremental Computation**: Cache-aware processing pipelines
- **Language Server Protocol**: Deep editor integration
- **Distributed Analysis**: Codebase processing at scale

### Theoretical Investigations
- Zero-allocation traversal strategies
- Lock-free concurrent pattern matching
- Memory-mapped file processing
- SIMD-accelerated string operations

### The Nature of Novel Bugs
As AI assistance evolves, we anticipate encountering failure modes without historical precedent. These will not be variations on known patterns but entirely new categories of errors arising from the intersection of human assumptions and machine logic. Our testing strategies must evolve accordingly.

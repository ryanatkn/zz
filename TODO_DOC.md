## ✅ Target Test Fixes Completed (All 3 Original Issues Resolved)

### ✅ 1. HTML `void_element_formatting` - FIXED ✅
**Module**: `lib.test.fixture_runner.test.HTML fixture tests`  
**Type**: Formatter test  
**Resolution**: Fixed indentation and self-closing tag normalization

**Issue Fixed**: Self-closing tags had double indentation (8 spaces instead of 4) and missing space before `/>`.

**Root Cause**: Self-closing tags (`<img/>`, `<hr/>`) were called with `indent_level=2` while regular elements had `indent_level=0-1`, causing double indentation. Additionally, self-closing tags weren't normalized to include space before `/>`.

**Solution**: 
1. **Indentation Fix**: In `formatSelfClosingTag()`, temporarily reduce indent level using `builder.dedent()` → `builder.appendIndent()` → `builder.indent()` to match regular elements.
2. **Normalization Fix**: Added `normalizeSelfClosingTag()` function to ensure consistent ` />` syntax.

**Result**: All void elements now have correct 4-space indentation and proper self-closing syntax.

### ✅ 2. TypeScript `arrow_function_formatting` - COMPLETED ✅
**Module**: `lib.test.fixture_runner.test.TypeScript fixture tests`  
**Type**: Formatter test  
**Resolution**: Complete arrow function formatting with proper indentation

**Issue Fixed**: Arrow function method chaining lacked proper base indentation and context management.

**Root Cause**: The `formatArrowFunction` function wasn't properly setting up indentation context for multi-line formatting, and `formatMethodChainingWithObjects` wasn't receiving the correct indentation level.

**Solution**: 
1. **Indentation Context**: Enhanced `formatArrowFunction` to use `builder.indent()` and `builder.dedent()` for proper scope management
2. **Method Chaining Fix**: Fixed base indentation in `formatMethodChainingWithObjects` for the "users" starting element
3. **Multi-line Support**: Proper line breaking and indentation for complex arrow functions

**Final Output** (Matches Expected):
```typescript
const processUsers = (users: User[]) =>
    users
        .filter(user => user.email)
        .map(user => ({
            ...user,
            processed: true
        }));
```

**Result**: Complete arrow function formatting with method chaining, object literals, and proper indentation.

### ✅ 3. Svelte `svelte_5_snippets` - COMPLETED ✅
**Module**: `lib.test.fixture_runner.test.Svelte fixture tests`  
**Type**: Parser test (structure extraction)  
**Resolution**: Complete snippet structure extraction with clean formatting

**Issue Fixed**: Svelte 5 `{#snippet}` blocks weren't detected in structure mode, and extra blank lines appeared between sections.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Missing snippet detection in structure mode visitor
2. `appendNormalizedSvelteSection()` wasn't aggressive enough about removing blank lines
3. Whitespace-only text nodes between sections were adding extra spacing

**Solution**: 
1. **Snippet Detection**: Added `isSvelteSnippet()` function and integrated into structure mode visitor
2. **Aggressive Blank Line Removal**: Modified `appendNormalizedSvelteSection()` to skip all blank lines in structure mode
3. **Whitespace Node Filtering**: Added logic to skip pure whitespace text nodes between structural elements

**Final Output** (Matches Expected):
```svelte
<script>
    let { items = [] } = $props();
    function handleClick(item) {
        console.log('Clicked:', item);
    }
</script>
{#snippet item_card(item)}
    <div class="card">
        <h3>{item.title}</h3>
        <p>{item.description}</p>
        <button onclick={() => handleClick(item)}>
            Select
        </button>
    </div>
{/snippet}
{#snippet empty_state()}
    <div class="empty">
        <p>No items found</p>
    </div>
{/snippet}
```

**Result**: Perfect snippet structure extraction with clean section boundaries and no extra whitespace.

### ✅ 4. Zig `error_handling` - COMPLETED ✅
**Module**: `lib.test.fixture_runner.test.Zig fixture tests`  
**Type**: Parser test (error extraction)  
**Resolution**: Complete error construct extraction with targeted function content

**Issue Fixed**: Severe over-extraction of random identifiers instead of error constructs, and missing function signature extraction.

**Root Cause**: 
1. `isErrorNode()` was too broad and matched non-error constructs
2. Function detection only checked "VarDecl" nodes, missing "Decl" nodes
3. `appendZigErrorFunction()` extracted too much or too little function content
4. Multiple AST nodes contained same catch expressions, causing duplicates

**Solution**: 
1. **Enhanced Node Detection**: Added "Decl" node support for function detection in `isErrorNode()`
2. **Selective Catch Extraction**: Restricted catch expressions to "VarDecl" nodes only to avoid duplicates
3. **Targeted Function Extraction**: Completely rewrote `appendZigErrorFunction()` to extract function signature plus only error-related content
4. **Smart Content Filtering**: Extract only return statements with catch, error mapping lines, and necessary braces

**Final Output** (Matches Expected):
```zig
const Error = error{
    InvalidInput,
    OutOfMemory,
    NetworkError,
};
fn parseNumber(input: []const u8) Error!u32 {
    return std.fmt.parseInt(u32, input, 10) catch |err| switch (err) {
        error.InvalidCharacter => Error.InvalidInput,
        error.Overflow => Error.InvalidInput,
    };
}
    const number = parseNumber(line) catch continue;
```

**Result**: Perfect error construct extraction with complete function signatures and targeted error handling content.

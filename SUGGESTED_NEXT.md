# Suggested Next Steps for zz

### 11. Build System Integration
**Impact:** Low | **Effort:** Medium
- Generate build dependency graphs
- Analyze build performance
- Detect circular dependencies
- Optimize build order

## Technical Debt Reduction

### 12. Code Quality Improvements
- ✅ Achieved 100% test coverage (302/302 tests passing)
- ✅ Eliminated ~500 lines of duplicate code through DRY architecture
- ✅ Standardized error handling patterns across all modules
- Add more comprehensive benchmarks for new helper modules
- Continue monitoring for new code duplication patterns

### 13. Build System Enhancements
- Simplify tree-sitter dependency management
- Add cross-compilation support
- Improve build caching
- Add development container support

### 14. Documentation Updates
- Add video tutorials
- Create cookbook with examples
- Improve API documentation
- Add architecture decision records (ADRs)

## Community Features

### 15. Ecosystem Development
- Create package registry for language grammars
- Add community pattern library
- Implement shareable configurations
- Build online playground

### 16. Developer Experience
- Add VS Code extension
- Create shell completions (bash, zsh, fish)
- Implement man pages
- Add inline help system

## Performance Targets

### Current Baselines (Debug Build) - Updated January 2025
- Path operations: ~51μs per operation (baseline maintained)
- String pooling: ~169ns per operation (stable)
- Memory pools: ~52μs per cycle (stable)
- Glob patterns: ~40ns per operation (maintained)
- Code extraction: ~95μs per extraction (stable with AST support)
- Cache operations: ~10-50ms cache hits, ~100ms cache misses
- Incremental processing: ~2-5ms change detection
- Parallel processing: Linear scaling up to CPU cores
- **DRY Architecture Impact**: Reduced code duplication by ~500 lines with no performance regression
- **Test Suite**: 302 tests passing (100% success rate) with comprehensive helper coverage

### Target Improvements
- 50% reduction in memory usage for large trees
- 2x faster glob pattern matching
- 10x faster incremental parsing
- Sub-millisecond response for most operations

- Memory usage under 50MB for typical projects
- 95% user satisfaction in usability testing
- Zero crashes in production use
- Sub-second response for all commands

## Notes for Contributors

When selecting tasks:
1. Start with high impact, low effort items
2. Ensure backward compatibility
3. Add tests for all new features
4. Update documentation immediately
5. Benchmark performance impacts
6. Consider POSIX compatibility
7. Keep the Unix philosophy in mind

Remember: Performance is a feature. Every millisecond counts.

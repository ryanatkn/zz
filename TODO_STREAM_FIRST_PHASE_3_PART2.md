# Phase 3 Part 2: Query Engine Fixes & Direct Stream Lexers

## Status Summary

### Completed (Phase 3 Core)
- ✅ **Query Engine Core**: SQL-like DSL with QueryBuilder
- ✅ **Query Optimization**: Predicate pushdown, cost estimation  
- ✅ **Query Planning**: Execution plan generation
- ✅ **Memory Management Fixes**: Resolved double-free issues
- ✅ **Query Benchmarks**: Added 4 query benchmarks to stream_first suite
- ✅ **Value Type Alignment**: Fixed Value type confusion between fact/query modules

### Test Results
- 221 tests passing (out of 229)
- 7 failing tests (known issues from Phase 2)
- Query tests now passing without crashes

### Performance (Benchmarks Added)
- Simple query (SELECT predicate): ~462μs/op
- Complex query (WHERE + ORDER BY + LIMIT): Pending validation
- Query optimization overhead: Pending measurement
- Query planning overhead: Pending measurement

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Memory Management (executor.zig)
- Fixed double-free in `applyWhere` by removing duplicate free
- Fixed `applyLimitOffset` to properly handle memory ownership
- Added `should_free_facts` flag to track ownership through pipeline

### 2. Query Builder (builder.zig)
- Removed automatic `deinit()` call in `execute()` method
- Caller now responsible for cleanup (prevents double-free)
- Added `query.deinit()` in execute to clean up Query allocations

### 3. Value Type Resolution
- Identified two Value types: fact/value.zig (extern union) vs query/operators.zig (tagged union)
- Query module uses tagged union Value for type safety
- Fixed `makeValue()` to convert Predicate enums to numbers
- Fixed `compareValues()` to handle tagged union properly

### 4. Benchmark Suite
- Added query benchmarks to stream_first.zig
- Tests simple queries, complex queries, optimization, and planning
- Fixed compilation issues with QueryPlanner initialization
- Fixed operator names (`.neq` not `.ne`)

## Remaining Work (Phase 3 Extensions)

### Direct Stream Lexers (Priority)
- [ ] JSON stream lexer - Zero-allocation streaming
- [ ] ZON stream lexer - Similar architecture  
- [ ] Remove LexerBridge dependency
- [ ] Validate 1-2 cycle dispatch claim

### Query Enhancements
- [ ] Multi-field ORDER BY (currently single field only)
- [ ] Streaming query execution (zero-allocation)
- [ ] GROUP BY/HAVING support
- [ ] Query result caching
- [ ] Parallel query execution

### Language Migration (Phase 4)
- [ ] TypeScript stream lexer
- [ ] Zig stream lexer
- [ ] CSS stream lexer
- [ ] HTML stream lexer
- [ ] Svelte (defer to Phase 5)

## Known Issues

### Query Module
1. Some query benchmarks may crash on complex queries
2. Multi-field sorting not implemented
3. GROUP BY/HAVING stubs only
4. Value type conversion needs refinement

### Memory Issues (Fixed)
- ✅ Double-free in QueryExecutor.execute
- ✅ QueryBuilder.execute double deinit
- ✅ applyLimitOffset slice vs allocation

### Type Issues (Fixed)
- ✅ Value extern union vs tagged union confusion
- ✅ Predicate to Value conversion
- ✅ Operator enum field names

## Architecture Insights

### Two-Value System
The architecture uses two different Value types by design:
1. **fact/value.zig**: Extern union (8 bytes) for compact fact storage
2. **query/operators.zig**: Tagged union for type-safe query operations

This separation allows:
- Compact 24-byte facts (performance critical)
- Type-safe query building (developer experience)
- Conversion happens at query execution boundary

### Memory Ownership Pattern
Query execution follows clear ownership rules:
1. `getBaseFacts()` allocates and returns ownership
2. `applyWhere()` takes ownership, frees input, returns new
3. `applyOrderBy()` modifies in-place (no allocation)
4. `applyLimitOffset()` may reallocate or return slice
5. Result takes final ownership

## Next Session Goals

1. **Create Direct Stream Lexers**
   - Start with JSON (simplest)
   - Achieve zero-allocation streaming
   - Benchmark vs bridge approach

2. **Validate Performance**
   - Run full benchmark suite
   - Verify <1μs simple query target
   - Measure tagged union dispatch cycles

3. **Complete Documentation**
   - Update architecture docs
   - Create query cookbook
   - Document stream lexer pattern

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Stream Lexers**: Core architecture proven, now optimize
2. **Leave TODOs**: GROUP BY/HAVING can wait for Phase 4
3. **Focus on Performance**: Validate all performance claims
4. **Document Patterns**: Stream lexer will be template for all languages

## Commands

```bash
# Run tests
zig test src/lib/test_stream_first.zig

# Run benchmarks
zig build benchmark

# Test query module specifically
zig test src/lib/test_stream_first.zig 2>&1 | grep query
```

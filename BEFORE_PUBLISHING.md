# BEFORE_PUBLISHING.md

**Final checklist and considerations before making zz public**

## Code Quality Checklist

### Critical Items
- [ ] Remove any hardcoded paths specific to your machine
- [ ] Ensure no API keys, tokens, or credentials anywhere (even in comments)
- [ ] Check that all tests pass in a fresh clone
- [ ] Verify binary builds on Linux and macOS
- [ ] Test with minimal Zig version (0.14.1)

### Performance Verification
- [ ] Run benchmarks in Release mode to get real numbers
- [ ] Update README.md with actual Release mode performance metrics
- [ ] Remove "Debug mode" qualifiers from performance claims
- [ ] Verify < 5MB binary size target is met in Release

## Documentation Review

### Remove Internal References
- [ ] Check for any personal usernames in example paths
- [ ] Remove references to internal projects or companies
- [ ] Sanitize any real-world paths in documentation
- [ ] Update git clone URL to actual repository

### Philosophy Consistency
- [ ] Ensure TASTE.md tone is what you want to project
- [ ] Review ANTIPATTERNS.md for anything too harsh
- [ ] Check that humor/frustration balance is appropriate
- [ ] Verify no contradictions between philosophy docs

## Legal & Licensing

### Add Missing Files
- [ ] LICENSE file (which license? MIT? BSD? Apache 2.0?)
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md link to CLA if needed
- [ ] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md if you want one
- [ ] SECURITY.md for vulnerability reporting

### Copyright Headers
```zig
// Consider adding to each source file:
// Copyright (c) 2024 [Your Name]
// SPDX-License-Identifier: [LICENSE]
```

## Repository Setup

### GitHub Configuration
- [ ] Set up branch protection for main
- [ ] Configure issue templates
- [ ] Add PR template if desired
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI
- [ ] Add topics: zig, cli, tools, performance

### Initial Release
- [ ] Create v0.1.0 tag (or v1.0.0 if confident)
- [ ] Write release notes highlighting key features
- [ ] Build and attach binaries to release
- [ ] Consider providing install script

## Technical Debt to Document

### Known Limitations
Be upfront about:
- Windows not supported (WSL required)
- Symlink handling differences between real/mock filesystem
- Memory pool benchmark variance in Debug mode
- No recursive pattern matching in gitignore

### Future Work
Clear about what's not done:
- `zz-ts`, `zz-web`, `zz-llm` are planned, not implemented
- Web UI integration is conceptual
- Plugin system explicitly rejected (document why)

## Community Preparation

### Expectations to Set
```markdown
## Contributing
We value:
- Performance over features
- Simplicity over flexibility  
- Breaking changes over technical debt
- Direct communication over diplomacy

We don't want:
- Windows support PRs
- Dependency additions
- Feature creep
- Emoji in output
```

### Response Templates
Prepare for common requests:
- "Can you add Windows support?" → No, use WSL
- "Can we use library X?" → No, zero dependencies
- "Can you add feature Y?" → Probably not, fork it
- "Why not Rust/Go/etc?" → We chose Zig, decision is final

## Marketing Considerations

### README.md First Impression
Current opening might be too blunt. Consider:
```markdown
# zz - Fast Command-Line Tools for Modern Development

Blazingly fa-- no. Actually fast CLI utilities written in Zig.
Zero dependencies. No compromises on performance.
```

### Demonstrate Value Immediately
```bash
# Show, don't tell
$ time zz tree ~/project
[output]
real    0m0.023s  # <-- Let the numbers speak

$ zz prompt "src/**/*.zig" | wc -l
4532  # Context ready for your LLM
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Backlash
- "Another tree command?" → Focus on speed and integration
- "Why not contribute to existing tools?" → Different philosophy
- "Zig is not production ready" → Our code is, that's what matters
- "No Windows support in 2024?" → We're not trying to please everyone

### Security Concerns
- Document that we never write files without explicit user action
- Clarify that pattern matching doesn't execute code
- Note that we don't make network requests
- Emphasize read-only operations by default

## Final Philosophical Check

### Are You Ready For:
- [ ] People who don't read docs complaining about missing features
- [ ] PRs that violate every principle in PHILOSOPHY.md
- [ ] Issues asking for things explicitly listed as non-goals
- [ ] Forks that add all the things you rejected
- [ ] Success potentially requiring you to say "no" a lot

### The Escape Hatch
Consider adding to README:
```markdown
## Fork-Friendly

Disagree with our decisions? Fork it. We made it easy:
- Zero dependencies means no dependency hell
- Clear module boundaries for easy modification
- Comprehensive tests to verify your changes
- No CLA, no barriers
```

## Quick Wins Before Launch

1. **Add benchmarks/** to .gitignore** (if not already)
2. **Set up GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: goto-bus-stop/setup-zig@v1
        with:
          version: 0.14.1
      - run: zig build test
      - run: zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

3. **Add installation instructions:**
```bash
# One-liner they can copy
curl -L https://github.com/YOU/zz/releases/latest/download/zz-linux | sudo install -m 755 /dev/stdin /usr/local/bin/zz
```

## The Most Important Question

**Is this the tool you want to maintain for the next 5 years?**

If yes, ship it. The code is solid, the philosophy is clear, and the documentation is comprehensive. Perfect is the enemy of good.

If no, consider what would need to change to make it something you'd be excited to maintain long-term.

*Remember: You can always improve after launch. Version 0.1.0 doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to work.*

*But once you go 1.0.0, the philosophy becomes harder to change. Make sure PHILOSOPHY.md and TASTE.md really represent what you want this project to be.*

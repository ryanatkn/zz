## Architecture Overview

**Separation of Concerns**
- `main.zig`: SDL3 application lifecycle, window management, and main event loop entry
- `game.zig`: Complete game logic, state management, and rendering using SDL3 APIs
- `game_data.zon`: Data-driven configuration for scenes, enemies, obstacles, and portals

**SDL3 Integration**
- Uses SDL3's modern application model with `SDL_RunApp` and callbacks
- Implements custom circle and shape drawing using SDL3 primitives
- Handles input through SDL3 event system
- Manages rendering through SDL3 renderer API

## Core Game Concepts

**Player**
- Blue circle that moves via mouse (left-click) or WASD/arrows  
- Shoots yellow bullets toward mouse cursor (right-click)
- Dies on contact with enemies or deadly obstacles
- Can resurrect in place or perform full restart

**Enemies** 
- Red circles using aggro/targeting system
- Chase player when `aggroTarget` is set (full speed)
- Return to spawn when no aggro target (1/3 speed, post-death)
- Navigate around obstacles with collision detection

**Obstacles**
- Green rectangles: blocking (stop movement)
- Purple rectangles: deadly (kill on contact)
- Both affect enemy pathfinding

**Portals**
- Orange shapes (circle/triangle/square) for scene transitions
- Shape indicates destination scene type
- Player teleports to center of destination scene

**Scenes**
- Multiple areas with unique layouts, backgrounds, and entity scaling
- Enemies respawn when entering scene via portal
- Current scene tracks all active entities

## SDL3 API Translation

**Performance Considerations**
- Custom circle rendering using line strips for efficiency
- Batched color changes to minimize SDL state switches  
- Event-driven input handling instead of polling
- Frame-rate independent timing using SDL ticks

## Game States

- **Normal**: Player alive, enemies chase (`aggroTarget = player.position`)
- **Game Over**: Player dead, enemies wander home (`aggroTarget = null`)  
- **Paused**: Game time stops, visual pause indicators
- **Victory**: All enemies defeated in current scene

## Controls (SDL3 Input Mapping)

- **Mouse**: Left = move target, Right = shoot bullets
- **WASD/Arrows**: Alternative keyboard movement
- **Space**: Pause toggle
- **R**: Resurrect (when dead) / Full restart (when alive)
- **T**: Reset current scene only
- **Y**: Full game restart
- **Escape**: Quit to CLI

## Implementation Status

**âœ… Completed**
- Basic SDL3 application structure
- Player movement and basic rendering
- Bullet firing system
- Event handling framework
- Game state structure

**ðŸš§ In Progress**
- Scene management and transitions
- Enemy AI and pathfinding
- Collision detection
- UI rendering (text, borders)

**ðŸ“‹ TODO**
- ZON data loading integration
- Complete rendering system (enemies, obstacles, portals)
- Camera system for scene scaling
- Audio system (if desired)
- Performance optimizations

## Development Notes

**SDL3 Specific Challenges**
- No built-in circle/ellipse primitives - requires custom implementation
- Camera transforms need manual implementation

**Memory Management**  
- Arena allocators for frame-scoped data
- ZON parsing handled by Zig's standard library
- SDL resources properly cleaned up in callbacks

**Future Enhancements**
- Hardware-accelerated circle rendering with shaders
- SDL3 audio integration for sound effects
- Gamepad support through SDL3 input system
- Multi-window support for debugging views
